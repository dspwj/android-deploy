Unlocking
=========
* Turn on tablet into bootloader mode (power + volume down)
* Connect one tablet at a time to the computer by USB
* Run 01_unlock_reboot.bat
	- This will unlock the device. Confirm with the power key on the device. 
	- Next the device will restart into the Android factory version.
* [repeat this step for all tablets] **There is no need to re-start the script as it will run continuously.**
* After the last tablet has been unlocked, close the script window to terminate it. 

Copying the backup files
========================
* Connect as many tablets to the computer by USB as possible (between 2 and 4 depending on the PC)
* In Windows Explorer copy the 'backup' folder
* In the 'My Computer' window right-click on each of the 'Nexus 7' symbol and choose paste
	- Wait for each of the file transfers to finish
* Unplug each tablet and turn them off
* [repeat this section in batches for all tablets]

Restore the backup
==================
* Turn on tablet into bootloader mode (power + volume down)
* Connect one tablet at a time to the computer by USB
* Run 02_recovery_rename_restore_new.bat
	- This will install the TWRP recovery software, move the 'backup' folder in the right location, and start the restore process
	- You can unplug the device as soon the recovery process starts ("[RESTORE STARTED]") 
* Plug in the next tablet (which should already be in bootloader mode at this point, see step 1), and repeat these steps until all tablets are done. **There is no need to re-start the script as it will run continuously.**
* Restoring on each tablet takes about 2 minutes 20 seconds. [optional: On the tablet click the button at the bottom center to confirm if Restoring has finished. Click the button again to return to the main menu]
* Click Reboot > System
* After the last tablet has been restored, close the script window to terminate it. 

Set the time
============
* Connect one tablet at a time to the computer by USB. (Tablets should be booted up normally but no need to open one of the two accounts.)
* Make sure the computer's clock is set accurately.
* Run 03_set_datetime_turnoff.bat
	- This will set the tablet to the current computer time.
	- Once the time is set the tablet will be turned off. 
* Plug in the next tablet and continue until all have been updated. 
* After the last tablet has been updated, close the script window to terminate it.
